### Add your first monitor using browser extension

Once you have added “Distill Web Monitor” extension/add-on to your browser, you would be able to see a Distill icon (a blue color drop icon) in your browser toolbar. If not, please check your extension/add-on list in browser and click on “Show button” (for Chrome and Opera) or drag the icon (for Firefox) to the toolbar.

Checkout following links to see the steps for your browser:

* [Chrome extension](https://distill.io/help/gettingstarted/chrome "gettingstarted:chrome")
* [Firefox add-on](https://distill.io/help/gettingstarted/firefox "gettingstarted:firefox")
* [Opera add-on](https://distill.io/help/gettingstarted/opera "gettingstarted:opera")
