### Add Monitors in Distill Web App

There are two ways to add webpages to  [Watchlist](https://distill.io/help/watchlist "watchlist"):

1.  Using “Distill Page” bookmarklet. It is the recommended way to add new monitors to your Watchlist in cloud.
    
2.  Using “Remote Browser”. It is described below. Some webpages that prevent loading scripts from external sources, bookmarklet does not work. In those cases, use a Remote Browser.
    

#### Using "Distill Page" bookmarklet

Step 1: Drag “Distill Page” link to your bookmarks toolbar. You can find “Distill page” bookmarklet in page footer. You may need to enable “Show bookmarks bar” in browser's setting to make it visible.

Step 2: Open a webpage to be monitored in a tab. Once page has finished loading, click “Distill page” bookmarklet in bookmarks bar. A Visual selector toolbar will load in the page.

Step 3: Hover mouse around the content in the page that you want to monitor. Once your desired content is inside the black box, “click” to select it. This makes the selection fixed. You can make multiple selections if you want to monitor different parts in the page. To “Expand”, “Contract” and “Delete” a selection, click the caret icon for the selection.

Step 4: Once you have made selections, click “Save Selection” from the  [Visual Selector](https://distill.io/help/visual-selector "visual-selector")toolbar.

Step 5: An “Options” page will open. Make changes to actions, schedule etc and save them.
